# Design: terraform-azure-machine

Why this module looks the way it does. Each decision names the evidence it
rests on; anything not yet checked against a real subscription is listed
under "Unverified" and must be confirmed on the first reviewed apply.

Pins: `hashicorp/azurerm` 5.7.0. Runtimes: Terraform >= 1.5, OpenTofu >= 1.6.
Conventions: [CONVENTIONS.md](CONVENTIONS.md). Contract:
<https://captf.io/docs/module-author/contract/v1alpha1/>.

This is the `machine` role. The decision and Unverified numbers are the same
in every terraform-azure-* repository, and the code cites them: a decision
that only concerns another role is a one-line stub that links to the repository
that owns it, and Unverified items of other roles are left out. The other roles:
[terraform-azure-cluster](https://github.com/captf-io/terraform-azure-cluster/blob/main/DESIGN.md) and
[terraform-azure-machinepool](https://github.com/captf-io/terraform-azure-machinepool/blob/main/DESIGN.md).

## Scope

- Bring-your-own network: the VNet, subnets and egress (NAT Gateway or
  firewall) exist before the cluster.
- Node identities (user-assigned managed identities) are created by the
  cluster role by default; variables take existing ones.
- Variable names follow the family table of CONVENTIONS.md section 8.
- `admin_ssh_public_key` is required: Azure Linux VMs need an SSH key or a
  password even when nobody logs in, and the module does not invent one.
  The cluster role takes it and exports it.

## Decisions

### 1. One resource group per cluster

Concerns the cluster role: see [terraform-azure-cluster DESIGN.md](https://github.com/captf-io/terraform-azure-cluster/blob/main/DESIGN.md#1-one-resource-group-per-cluster).

### 2. API load balancer and hairpin

- Standard Load Balancer, internal by default (frontend in the subnet,
  dynamic or a configured static IP); public uses a Standard static public
  IP. Both set zones explicitly (every zone of the region) and ignore later
  changes to them: `zones` is ForceNew without Computed on the public IP
  (`ZonesMultipleOptionalForceNew`, `network/public_ip_resource.go`), and a
  frontend zones change forces a new load balancer
  (`loadbalancer/lb_resource.go` CustomizeDiff, `d.ForceNew(...zones)`),
  so a reported difference would replace the endpoint. The internal
  frontend's `ignore_changes = [frontend_ip_configuration[0].zones]` covers
  that case, which the first draft left open.
- Rules: TCP endpoint port to the kube-apiserver backend port (and 9345 to
  9345 with `distribution = "rke2"`). The backend port equals the endpoint
  port (`cluster_network.api_server_port ?? 6443`) with kubeadm and is
  always 6443 with RKE2, which reads neither field (control-planes/rke2.md;
  CONVENTIONS.md section 12); the first draft used the endpoint port for
  RKE2 too, so its load balancer would never turn healthy on another port.
  An endpoint port of 9345 with RKE2 fails a precondition. Also
  `tcp_reset_enabled = true`, probes every 5 s. `disable_outbound_snat` is
  set for a public frontend only: an internal frontend has no outbound SNAT
  to disable.
- Probes: HTTPS `GET /readyz` on the API port for kubeadm (anonymous
  `/readyz` is allowed by default), so a listening but unready API server
  gets no traffic; TCP with `distribution = "rke2"`, where anonymous auth may be
  off, and TCP on 9345 (its readyz answers 403, which an Azure probe counts
  as down). Changed from "TCP probes" in the first draft; both forms are
  allowed by control-planes/checklist.md "Health checks".
- Control-plane machines join the backend pool with
  `azurerm_network_interface_backend_address_pool_association` in their own
  state, before the VM boots.
- An internal Standard Load Balancer does not hairpin: a backend's flow to
  its own frontend that is mapped back to itself fails. The machine role
  therefore wraps control-plane `custom_data` (cloud-config only) in a MIME
  multipart whose `text/cloud-boothook` installs a small service: while the
  local apiserver answers `/readyz`, it DNATs traffic for the frontend IP
  and port to the node's own address (the source address of its route to
  the frontend), which the apiserver advertises whatever its bind address;
  otherwise it removes the rule. The service is a transient systemd unit
  started with `systemd-run --no-block` (no daemon-reload; cloud-init's
  boothook runs before the boot transaction a blocking start would wait
  for). The first draft DNATed to `127.0.0.1`, which fails when the
  apiserver binds only its node address. While a node's
  own apiserver is down its probe is down too, so its join traffic goes to
  other backends; once healthy it reaches itself locally.
  `api_server_hairpin_workaround = false` turns the workaround off (Ignition users add the equivalent to their
  `preKubeadmCommands`, as CAPZ's private-cluster guide does).
- With RKE2 (`supervisor_port` in exports) the service also DNATs 9345 and
  counts a 401 or 403 from `/readyz` as up: RKE2 may run the apiserver
  without anonymous auth, and a 200-only check left the workaround inert
  (review finding). A precondition on the VM requires the exported address
  and ports to be an IPv4 address and port numbers, since they reach a root
  shell script (`external_cluster_exports` is user input).
- No `prevent_destroy`: it would block deleting the cluster too. CAPTF's
  destructive-plan guard stops only deletes and replacements, and azurerm
  5.7.0 changes a frontend's public IP, private address and subnet and the
  rule ports in place (adding or removing a frontend no longer forces a new
  load balancer; only zones do), so those changes would move the endpoint
  without any delete, which the first draft missed.
  `terraform_data.api_endpoint_guard` (the pattern of the OpenStack modules)
  records `api_load_balancer_public`, the port, the control-plane subnet and the
  private address the frontend actually got, with `ignore_changes` on its
  input, and a postcondition fails any later plan that changes them, naming
  the recorded and requested values. Making the current dynamic address
  static is allowed: it moves nothing. The endpoint-stability rule of
  cluster.md is thereby enforced, not just documented.

### 3. Network security groups

NSGs are attached at the NIC, not the bring-your-own subnet. No inline
`security_rule` blocks: the CCM adds Service rules to the worker NSG and
inline rules would fight it (`security_rule` is Optional+Computed in
azurerm 5.7.0, so CCM rules cause no drift). Application security groups
identify control plane and workers. Rules:

- both roles: SSH (22/tcp) allowed from `ssh_allowed_cidrs` (priority
  100) and denied from anywhere else (110), ahead of the intra-cluster
  allow, so the secure default "no SSH" holds against AllowVnetInBound and
  between nodes (review finding: the first draft let the network reach SSH
  on workers);
- both roles: everything between the ASGs (priority 120);
- control plane: the API ports from `VirtualNetwork` (130) in both modes (workers
  reach the apiserver directly through the `kubernetes` Service, and an
  internal LB keeps the client address), from `api_allowed_cidrs`
  (140) too (required when public; must include the NAT Gateway's IPs), and a
  final deny of `VirtualNetwork` inbound at 4096 that overrides Azure's
  AllowVnetInBound; AllowAzureLoadBalancerInBound stays for probes.
- workers: no final deny. cloud-provider-azure adds no NSG rule for an
  internal Service load balancer without source ranges and relies on
  AllowVnetInBound (`pkg/provider/loadbalancer/accesscontrol.go`,
  `IsAllowFromInternet` and `DenyAllExceptSourceRanges`: "By default, NSG
  allow traffic from the VNet"), so a deny there would cut internal
  LoadBalancer Services off from the network. The first draft denied the
  network on both roles.

Custom priorities stay within Azure's 100-4096 and below 500, where the
CCM's rules start.

### 4. Node identities

Concerns the cluster role: see [terraform-azure-cluster DESIGN.md](https://github.com/captf-io/terraform-azure-cluster/blob/main/DESIGN.md#4-node-identities).

### 5. provider_id

`azure:///subscriptions/<sub>/resourceGroups/<rg>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/<name>`.
cloud-provider-azure v1.37.0 returns the ARM ID through
`ConvertResourceGroupNameToLower` (`pkg/provider/azure_wrap.go`), so the
module builds the ID from a lowercased subscription and resource group and
requires a lowercase resource group name. Re-checked on `release-1.34`:
`availabilitySet.GetInstanceIDByNodeName` (`azure_standard.go`) returns
`ConvertResourceGroupNameToLower(*machine.ID)` for the VM it finds by Node
name, so the Node must be named after the VM: the examples set
`nodeRegistration.name: '{{ ds.meta_data["local_hostname"] }}'`, and the
VM name and `computer_name` are both `machine_name` made valid (lowercase
`[a-z0-9-]`, at most 64; otherwise cut to 55 plus `-` and 8 hex of its
sha256). Scale set instances:
`.../virtualMachineScaleSets/<vmss>/virtualMachines/<instance-id>`
(`azure_vmss.go` `vmssVMProviderIDRE`).

### 6. Machine

- `azurerm_linux_virtual_machine`, `computer_name = name = machine_name`
  made valid, password authentication off, extension operations off,
  optional trusted launch (secure boot, vTPM), optional encryption at host,
  boot diagnostics, user-assigned identity.
- Trusted launch is off by default, a change from the first draft: CAPZ
  says its reference images do not support it ("Trusted launch supported
  OS images are not included in the list of `capi` reference images",
  CAPZ `docs/book/src/self-managed/trusted-launch-for-vms.md`), and the
  examples use them. Turn it on with an image built for it.
- `image_id` takes any ID `source_image_id` accepts; `{version}` and
  `{semver}` in it become the Machine's version (`v1.31.4`, `1.31.4`;
  CONVENTIONS.md section 8, which replaced the first draft's
  `{kubernetes_version}`), without any `+suffix`, so the
  CAPZ community gallery
  (`/communityGalleries/ClusterAPI-f72ceb4f-5159-4c26-a0fe-2ea738f0d019/images/capi-ubun2-2404/versions/<1.x.y>`,
  CAPZ `azure/defaults.go` and `azure/services/virtualmachineimages/images.go`)
  follows version upgrades with one setting. azurerm 5.7.0 parses
  community and shared gallery IDs case-sensitively
  (`compute/parse/community_gallery_image_version.go`: `communityGalleries`,
  `images`, `versions`); the validation enforces that form.
- Custom data, not `user_data`: user data is exposed through IMDS, custom
  data is not. Ignition goes in verbatim; gzipped Ignition fails a
  precondition (CONVENTIONS.md section 13). Spot on a control-plane machine
  fails a precondition (section 11). The boothooks are POSIX sh, and the
  MIME envelope (`templates/user_data.mime.tftpl`: no preamble, parts
  `captf-boothook.sh` and `bootstrap`) and the pool's node-labels fragment
  (`templates/node_labels.tftpl`) are the family's shared copies. cloud-config goes in a MIME
  multipart: a `text/cloud-boothook` part (below), then the bootstrap data
  as a base64 part that is never decoded, `text/plain` so cloud-init
  detects the type itself (which keeps CABPK's `## template: jinja` header
  working; a `text/cloud-config` part would skip the Jinja rendering of
  `{{ ds.meta_data.local_hostname }}`), or `application/x-gzip` when the
  base64 starts with `H4sI`, which cloud-init decompresses first
  (`cloudinit/user_data.py`, `TYPE_NEEDED`, `DECOMP_TYPES`). The base64 is
  wrapped at 76 characters (RFC 2045). Precondition: at most 87380 base64
  characters, the encoding of Azure's 65535-byte limit.
- The boothook writes `/etc/kubernetes/azure.json` only when it is absent
  (boothooks run on every boot; a file the bootstrap data writes must keep
  winning after a reboot), the cloud-provider-azure
  config, from the cluster's `exports.cloud_provider_config` plus the
  node's identity client ID (`useManagedIdentityExtension`, no secret), and
  on control-plane nodes starts the hairpin service. Without azure.json the
  CCM cannot start, Nodes keep their uninitialized taint and never get a
  provider ID, and no Machine gets its Node; the derived names (resource
  group, NSG, identity client IDs) are not something a user can easily
  write into a KubeadmConfig, so the module provides it. This is new
  relative to the first draft. Ignition users write it themselves.
- Without exports (externally managed cluster, no
  `external_cluster_exports`) every resource has count 0 and a
  precondition on the listing data source explains what to set: with the
  VM itself as the primary resource, the NIC's null `location` failed plan
  first with "Missing required argument".
- The azurerm VM resource has no power state. `data.azurerm_virtual_machine`
  has it but errors on a 404, which would fail every refresh and destroy
  once the VM is gone. So `data.azurerm_resources` (an empty list, not an
  error, when the VM is missing; it does not reference the VM resource, so
  its count is known at plan time) guards a counted
  `data.azurerm_virtual_machine`. On the first apply health is `pending`
  until the next refresh; ARM listings can lag minutes.
- Spot: `priority = "Spot"`, `eviction_policy = "Deallocate"`,
  `max_bid_price = -1`. Pools use `Delete` instead ([machinepool DESIGN.md](https://github.com/captf-io/terraform-azure-machinepool/blob/main/DESIGN.md#7-machine-pool), decision 7).
- Zones from exports; with no `failure_domain` the zone is picked from the
  sha256 of `machine_name`. Regions without zones use an availability set
  for control-plane machines.

### 7. Machine pool

Concerns the machine pool role: see [terraform-azure-machinepool DESIGN.md](https://github.com/captf-io/terraform-azure-machinepool/blob/main/DESIGN.md#7-machine-pool).

### 8. Health

VM `power_state` (prefix stripped by the provider): running → running;
starting or empty → pending; stopping, stopped, deallocating, deallocated
→ stopped; any other state → unknown. VM in the state but not listed (the
first apply, listing lag) → pending; VM dropped from the state by a refresh
→ terminated, with a null `provider_id`. Each `health_by_state` entry
carries its reason (`PowerState/<state>`; `UnknownState` for anything
else). A pool follows CONVENTIONS.md section 10 ([machinepool DESIGN.md](https://github.com/captf-io/terraform-azure-machinepool/blob/main/DESIGN.md#7-machine-pool), decision 7). A resource deleted out of band leaves the
state on refresh; every output reads such attributes through `try()` or
`one()`.

### 9. Tags

Azure tag names cannot contain `< > % & \ ? /`: `captf.io/cluster` →
`captf.io_cluster`. `additional_tags` may hold 44 tags (Azure's 50 minus
the six captf tags). Values up to 256 characters (longer: 247 plus `-` plus
8 hex of sha256). Not taggable: role assignments, security rules, load
balancer pools, probes and rules, NIC associations, and the OS disks and
NICs a scale set creates; the cluster resource group is the attribution
boundary for those.

### 10. Credentials

Identity Secret: `ARM_TENANT_ID`, `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`, `ARM_CLIENT_ID`,
`ARM_CLIENT_SECRET`, `ARM_USE_CLI=false` (no `az` CLI in the image), or
a client certificate: `ARM_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE` (base64) or
`ARM_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PATH` (a file under `/var/run/captf/credentials/`),
with `ARM_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`. The provider block sets
`resource_provider_registrations = "none"` (registration of Compute,
Network, ManagedIdentity, Authorization and Insights is a prerequisite) and
`subscription_id` from exports for machine and pool. The job's identity
needs Contributor on the subscription (to create resource groups; it also
covers joining the subnets, which must be in that subscription) and Role
Based Access Control Administrator with a condition limiting assignable
roles. Network Contributor on the network's group is only needed if
Contributor is narrowed.

### 11. Region and zones

The location is the brought virtual network's: NICs cannot use a subnet in
another region, so a `location` variable could only be wrong. The zones are
the cluster's, published in its exports; [cluster DESIGN.md](https://github.com/captf-io/terraform-azure-cluster/blob/main/DESIGN.md#11-region-and-zones)
describes how brought dependencies are found without blocking a destroy.
The machine's listing of its VM works the same way.

### 12. Tooling

Concerns how the module images are tested, not this repository: see the [module-images README](https://github.com/captf-io/module-images#developing).

## Exports consumed

The machine reads the cluster's `captf.io/azure-cluster/v1` exports, listed
under "Exports" in the [cluster DESIGN.md](https://github.com/captf-io/terraform-azure-cluster/blob/main/DESIGN.md#exports-captfioazure-clusterv1)
and documented in the
[cluster README](https://github.com/captf-io/terraform-azure-cluster#exports).
For an externally managed TerraformCluster, `external_cluster_exports`
takes an object of that shape.

## Unverified

**4.** The ARM `custom_data` limit as 65535 decoded bytes (87380 base64
characters).

**5.** Public load balancer hairpin through SNAT; RKE2 needing the hairpin
workaround at all; the DNAT to the node's own address working with every
CNI's iptables rules.

**6.** Resolved: the CAPZ reference images do not support trusted launch (CAPZ
docs), so it is off by default.

**7.** cloud-init running the Jinja template of a `text/plain` part inside a
multipart (CABPK's `## template: jinja` header) on the CAPZ images'
cloud-init version.

**9.** cloud-provider-azure with `vmType: "vmss"` handling the standalone VMs of
the machine role next to the scale sets (CAPZ uses `vmss` for the same
mix).

**10.** The CAPZ community gallery publishing an image for every Kubernetes
version a cluster rolls to.

**12.** RKE2's apiserver answering `/readyz` with 401 or 403 when anonymous
auth is off, and the hairpin's 9345 DNAT being needed at all.

The numbers are those of the other terraform-azure-* repositories; the gaps are
items of the other roles.

## Rejected alternatives

- Requiring users to write `/etc/kubernetes/azure.json` through
  KubeadmConfig `files` (names they cannot know; decision 6).
- `user_data` (exposed through IMDS).
- A generated or "sealed" SSH key (state secret, or trust in an unprovable
  claim).
